This is a QR generator app which takes the business form data and creates QR code.
On scanning the QR code we get the data entered in the business form.
Also it has three screens one the homescreen,second one is the form screen and the third one is the qrcode show screen.
Also the download button when clicked downloads the QR code in a file path.And redirects to the homescreen.
I have attached the snapshots of the same.
